### README: Manual Installation of Python C-Extension Module

#### Project: wepppyo3
A Python C-extension module generated from Rust using `pyo3`.

#### Manual Installation Steps
Here's a step-by-step guide to manually install the `wepppyo3` module:

1. **Build the Rust project**
   - Navigate to your Rust project directory.
   - Run `cargo build --release`.
   - Locate `cli_revision_rust.so` in `target/release/`.

2. **Install the Shared Object File**
   - Create a directory named `wepppyo3` in your Python's `dist-packages` or `site-packages` folder. Use the appropriate folder path based on your Python version and installation method.
     ```sh
     sudo mkdir /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/wepppyo3
     ```
   - Move `cli_revision_rust.so` to the `wepppyo3` directory.
     ```sh
     sudo mv /path_to_your_so_file/cli_revision_rust.so /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/wepppyo3
     ```
   - Create an `__init__.py` file in the `wepppyo3` directory to make it a valid Python package.
     ```sh
     sudo touch /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/wepppyo3/__init__.py
     ```

3. **Usage in Python**
   - Import and use the module in Python.
     ```python
     from wepppyo3.cli_revision_rust import cli_revision
     ```

#### Notes for Future Us:

- **Python Version**: Always check your Python version. Adjust paths based on where your specific version of Python expects to find packages.
  
- **Permissions**: Ensure permissions are set correctly on the `.so` file and directory so that Python can read them. Use `chmod` or `chown` as necessary.

- **Virtual Environments**: If using a virtual environment (and you should for many projects), adjust the installation path to the `site-packages` directory of the virtual environment, and you won‚Äôt need sudo for file operations.

- **Dependencies**: Keep track of dependencies. If your module depends on specific versions of other libraries, make sure to document and ensure they're installed in your Python environment.

- **Backup**: Before performing manual installations, especially in system directories, consider creating backups or using a virtual machine/container.

#### Potential Troubleshooting Steps:
- **Import Issues**: If the module does not import, check `sys.path` to ensure Python is looking in the right place.
- **Dependency Issues**: Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and importable.
- **Symbol Issues**: Use `nm` or `ldd` to debug symbol and dependency issues in the shared object file.

#### Alternative: Packaging with `maturin`
While manual installation works, consider using `maturin` or a similar tool for building, packaging, and distributing your Python module, especially if you plan to share it with others.

May this README serve our future selves well, and guide us (or save us) during the inevitable debugging sessions. May our code be bug-free and our coffee cups full. üöÄüêû‚òï
